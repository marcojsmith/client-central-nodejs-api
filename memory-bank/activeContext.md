## Active Context

- We are currently implementing the "create ticket" feature for the Client Central API.
- The goal is to enable users to create new tickets via the API.
- We are following a test-driven development approach, using Jest for unit testing.
- We have reviewed the API documentation and existing codebase (`src/apiClient.js`, `src/server.js`, `src/config.js`).
- We have created a detailed plan for implementation and testing, documented in `planning/create_ticket_plan.md`.
- We will now switch to "Code Mini" mode to set up the testing environment, write tests, and implement any necessary code changes.
- We will start by creating a test file `createTicket.test.js` and setting up Jest.
- We will focus on testing the required fields for ticket creation first.
- We will use data from ticket 630308 for testing purposes, mocking API responses to ensure isolated unit tests.

## Progress

**Completed:**

- Read Memory Bank Files
- Reviewed API documentation (`CC_API_docs` directory) to understand the "create ticket" API and related functionalities.
- Reviewed existing codebase (`src/apiClient.js`, `src/server.js`, `src/config.js`) to understand API client setup, server routes, and configuration loading.
- Created a detailed plan for implementing and testing the "create ticket" feature using Jest, documented in `planning/create_ticket_plan.md`.

**Current Status:**

- In the planning phase, transitioning to implementation.
- Ready to switch to "Code Mini" mode to start setting up the testing environment and writing tests.

**Next Steps:**

- Switch to "Code Mini" mode.
- Create test file `createTicket.test.js`.
- Set up Jest testing environment.
- Implement mocks for API client and configuration.
- Implement test cases for "create ticket" functionality (required fields), using data from ticket 630308 (mocked).
- Run tests and ensure they pass.
- Update memory bank with implementation details and test results.

**Issues and Risks:**

- None identified yet.

**Notes:**

- We are focusing on test-driven development and unit testing using Jest.
- We are using ticket 630308 data for testing and mocking API responses.
- We are prioritizing testing the required fields for ticket creation initially.

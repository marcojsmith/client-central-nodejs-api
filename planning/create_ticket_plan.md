# Plan: Implement "Create Ticket" Feature with Jest Testing

**Objective:** Implement and test the "create ticket" feature for the Client Central API, focusing on required fields and using Jest for unit testing.

**Test-Driven Development Approach:**

1.  **Read Memory Bank Files:** Ensure we have the latest project context.
2.  **Review API Client & Server Code (`src/apiClient.js`, `src/server.js`):** Understand the existing code structure and identify the `createTicket` function and route. **(Completed in Architect Mode)**
3.  **Create Test File (`createTicket.test.js`):** Create a Jest test file in the project root (or `test` directory if it exists).
4.  **Fetch Ticket 630308 Details (Mocked):** In the test setup, implement a function to fetch ticket 630308 details using `apiClient.getTicketById()`. This will be mocked to avoid actual API calls during testing.
5.  **Test "Create Ticket" Functionality (Required Fields):** Write Jest test cases for the `createTicket` function and `POST /api/v1/tickets` route, focusing on the required fields (`subject`, `description`). Use data from ticket 630308 (mocked) to construct valid test payloads.
    *   Test successful ticket creation with required fields.
    *   Test error handling for missing required fields.
    *   (Optional) Add more test cases as needed.
6.  **Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`):** Update memory bank files to reflect the implemented feature and testing.
7.  **Request Mode Switch to "Code Mini":** Switch to "Code Mini" mode to implement the code changes (testing setup, mocks, assertions, etc.).

**Testing Framework:** Jest

**Test File Location:** `createTicket.test.js` in the project root (or `test` directory if created in "Code Mini" mode).

**Note:** We will focus on testing the required fields for ticket creation initially and may add tests for optional fields later if needed. We will use data from ticket 630308 to create test payloads and mock API responses to ensure isolated unit tests.

**Checklist:**

1.  [x] Read Memory Bank Files
2.  [x] Review API Client & Server Code (`src/apiClient.js`, `src/server.js`)
3.  [ ] Create Test File (`createTicket.test.js`)
4.  [ ] Fetch Ticket 630308 Details (Mocked)
5.  [ ] Test "Create Ticket" Functionality (Required Fields)
6.  [ ] Update Memory Bank (`progress.md`, `activeContext.md`)
7.  [ ] Request Mode Switch to "Code Mini"

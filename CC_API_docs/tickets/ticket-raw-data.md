    description: `<div><strong><u>Description of the issue:<br></u></strong>The employee applied for leave before the holiday calendar had been updated with the correct public holidays for 2023.<br>Once the holiday calendar had been updated, a recalculation was to be run on the employee to adjust the leave booking.<br>When trying to run the leave booking recalculation an error was given that an issue on a different leave booking caused the recalculation to fail.<br><br><strong><u>Root cause:<br></u></strong>Under further investigation it was found that the employee had multiple time alerts which were preventing a recalculation from proceeding. In the time alert 2 leave bookings were specifically mentioned, cancelling these two leave booking allowed the recalculation to occur on the employee's time accounts. However, the balances of the employee then greatly differed between the TEST system on which these changes were made and the PROD system where no changes had been made. It was then identified that there had been a data issue on the work schedule assigned to the employee, which had caused additional leave bookings to be incorrectly calculated as far back as 2018.<br><br>The work schedule has a starting date, that defines on which date the first day of the week should start. The days defined in the work schedule the lead one after each other from that date, until the end of the defined days after which it repeats. The starting date of the work schedule "Flexi Shift - 5.25 Hours" was set to start on a Thursday, meaning that Saturdays and Sundays were not accounted for correctly.<br><br>After the recalculation of the leave bookings of the employee, which now was showing the correct deductions based on the work schedule, had caused the balance of the employee to drop significantly for Annual, Sick, and Time in lieu of.<br><br>There are 10 additional employees that appear on the admin alerts page for errors on Recalculating Absences and 25 employees with errors on Recalculating Accruals that need to be investigated to determine how to correct each employee. All employees that were assigned the work schedule "Flexi Shift - 5.25 Hours" should be reviewed to determine whether their balances are likely to change after a recalculation. And then all employees should be reviewed as a recalculation of absences linked to the holiday calendar "SA_Public_Holidays" is also required, to confirm if any employees submitted leave before the holiday calendar was adjusted.<br><br><strong><u>Next steps</u></strong></div><ol><li>EPI-USE will do a review in the TEST instance of all the employees that have errors on the Admin alerts page for Recalculating Absences.<br>Each employee will be reviewed in terms of how to correct the issue, and whether a business decision is required to complete the proposed solution.</li><li>Allan Gray to then review the proposed solution for each employee in terms of any HR &amp; Payroll decisions that need to be made, and the communication to the employee on the expected change of their balance.</li><li>Once all the errors on the Admin alerts page for Recalculating Absences has been corrected, a Time off balances report will be run on all employees that are assigned to the work schedule "Flexi Shift - 5.25 Hours" and a separate report on all employees assigned to the holiday calendar "SA_Public_Holidays".<br>The balance report will be used to compare to after the recalculation of absences has been completed to determine if there are any employees whose balances may change.</li><li>A recalculation of absences will be triggered on all employees that have been assigned the work schedule "Flexi Shift - 5.25 Hours" and those that have assigned the holiday calendar "SA_Public_Holidays".</li><li>A time off balances report will be run once the recalculations have been completed, to determine if there is a difference to the balance of any employees.</li><li>Once the proposed solutions have been approved, and the it has been verified that there will not be any further adverse affects to any employee's time off balances, the changes will then be moved to PROD.</li></ol>`,
